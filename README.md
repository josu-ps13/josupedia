Summaries I have made along my years of study. They include mathematical formulas, visual elements and code. Currently two topics:

* **Summary on Medical Image Processing**: a compendium of image enhancement, filtering, segmentation, registration, visualization, compression and classification techniques, learned during my Bachelor's Degree on Biomedical Engineering at UC3M.

* **Summary on Machine Learning**: an organized summary of data preprocessing techniques, machine learning algorithms, deep learning, natural language processing and computer vision, learned during my Master's Degree on Machine Learning for Health at UC3M.

Parts highlighted in yellow are incomplete and will be added in the future... hopefully. Contact me at josu.ps13@gmail.com in case you are interested in the original Microsoft Word files for editing, expanding or updating the contents of the summary.
